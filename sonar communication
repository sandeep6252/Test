Subject: SonarQube Upgrade – Important Update & Required Actions for Application Teams

Dear Application Teams,

The DevOps team performed an upgrade of the SonarQube PROD instance on 3rd August 2025. During the post-upgrade validation, we identified that multiple existing rules in the quality profiles had been modified as part of the upgrade. As a result, code that previously passed the quality gate began to fail due to these updated rules.

To avoid disruption to ongoing development and deployments, the DevOps team has temporarily rolled back the SonarQube version to the previous stable release. However, to ensure a smooth and controlled adoption of the updated rules, we are implementing a phased mitigation plan that will allow development teams sufficient time to address new rule violations.

⸻

Mitigation Plan
	•	A new Drop-Down option will be introduced in all DEV pipelines, allowing developers to run SonarQube scans against either:
	•	SONARQUBE-DEV instance, or
	•	SONARQUBE-LAB instance.
	•	The SONARQUBE-LAB instance has been upgraded to the latest version. It will perform full code scans using the modified rules, giving teams visibility into new rule violations.
	•	Currently, all DEV pipelines run SonarQube scans using the existing PROD-compatible rules.
The new Drop-Down option will allow teams to voluntarily switch scans to the LAB instance and begin addressing updated rule violations ahead of the final rollout.
	•	This option will be available for three months, giving all teams adequate time to review and remediate issues before the SonarQube upgrade is pushed again to the PROD instance.
	•	By 10th December, all DEV pipelines managed by the DevOps team will include a new parameter:
RUN_SONAR_ON
(Options: SONARQUBE-DEV / SONARQUBE-LAB)

⸻

Action Required
	•	Once the new parameter becomes available, teams should begin scanning their code against SONARQUBE-LAB to understand the impact of the upcoming rule changes.
	•	Address any identified rule violations during the three-month transition window.
	•	Ensure your code remains compliant when the upgraded rules are finally enforced in PROD.

If your team needs assistance or has concerns regarding this transition, please reach out to the DevOps team.

Thank you for your cooperation and support.

Regards,
DevOps Team
